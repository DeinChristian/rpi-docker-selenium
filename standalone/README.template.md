## What is Selenium?
_Selenium automates browsers._ That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) also be automated as well.

Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.

See the Selenium [site](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) for documation on usage within your test code.

## Getting Help

### User Group

The first place where people ask for help about Selenium is the [Official User Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/selenium-users). Here, you'll find that most of the time, someone already found the problem you are facing right now, and usually reached the solution for which you are looking.

_Note: Please make sure to search the group before asking for something. Your question likely won't get answered if it was previously answered in another discussion!_

### Chat Room

The best place to ask for help is the user group (because they also keep the information accessible for others to read in the future). However, if you have a very important (or too simple) issue that needs a solution ASAP, you can always enter the IRC chat room. You might just find someone ready to help on `#selenium` at [Freenode](https://freenode.net/) or [SeleniumHQ Slack](https://seleniumhq.herokuapp.com/)
